# Suprabhat's DSA Repo™️

 > “Why bother showing off your real-world projects when they’d rather watch you juggle arrays and pointers for knowing your true potential”

## What’s Inside
- **Arrays**: Shuffle, slice, repeat, because your favorite interviewers love 15 variations of the same question.
- **Linked Lists**: Singly, doubly, circular, because pointers are life, right?
- **Trees & Graphs**: Practice until your brain turns into a red–black forest.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Memorize 500 patterns so you can DP your way out of any “tricky” puzzle.
- **Miscellanous**: Heaps, hashes, bit magic, because why not collect every buzzword?

## Why You’re Here
1. **You heard DSA is the 🔑 to Big Tech.**  
2. **You downloaded 12 courses, watched 300 lectures,** yet still can’t explain Quicksort in plain English.  
3. **You’ll spend 4 hours solving “minimum path sum”** just to prove you love suffering.

## How to “Use” This Repo
1. Clone it: `git clone https://github.com/Suprabhat3/DSA.git`  
2. Open your IDE.  
3. Panic as you read the problem statements.  
4. Code furiously.  
5. Submit on LeetCode.  
6. Repeat until you forget your own name.

## Disclaimer
- **This will not teach you real-world coding,** but you’ll be ready to impress recruiters with “optimized” O(n log n) solutions.  
- **Side effects** may include: existential dread, coffee addiction, and random nightmares about stack overflows.
